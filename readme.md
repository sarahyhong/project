## READ ME!

The code in this repository is code for PIC 10C. After some experimentation, 
I was able to learn more about git and figure out how to use gitbash.
I found this assignment really helpful. I hope everything will go smoothly.

## The project

So this project wasn't really for anything in particular. I was trying to integrate what I learned from my previous PIC classes to here.
I was hoping that I could do more in terms of making a more beneficial project, but it was already so much to learn how to use git.
